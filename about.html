          <h5>Jan 2019 - Jul 2019</h5>
          <p>
            I helped guide a class of students with no prior experience in
            programming or networking to become knowledgeable superstars in the
            Cybersecurity world. This 24-week course covered an array of topics,
            from Kali Linux to high level concepts such as governance risk
            compliance, SIEM, and Malware Analysis. I advised students through
            difficult concepts and encouraged them to develop their knowledge
            further. I came into this course as both a mentor and a student,
            learning more advanced tools and trade techniques along the way. It
            helped bolster my confidence not only in my abilities, but reassured
            me that Cybersecurity was the industry that I wanted to spend the
            rest of my life in.

            Maintaining the college's numerous computer labs was my number one
            priority. I learned many basic troubleshooting and computer
            maintenance concepts. I volunteered to complete many special
            projects in addition to my other duties. Firstly, I created a map of
            all ports and their corresponding positions on the network rack for
            the computer science building. Secondly, I helped setup a secondary
            network rack for students pursuing IT careers. Finally, I created a
            Standard Operating Procedures guide for Veyon, a student monitoring
            software for teachers to create a more interactive space within the
            classroom.
